# AttentionTestGenerator

AttentionTestGenerator is a Python script, which creates FullHD images of an attention task. I use it for empirical research on program comprehension (see [Brains on Code](https://github.com/brains-on-code)).
This means the script is very personalized to my usage, and probably not directly useful to you without changes.

**Disclaimer: I am not a Python programmer and don't really know what I'm doing.**


## Setup ##

The project should run in any Python IDE. It was developed and tested with [PyCharms](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
